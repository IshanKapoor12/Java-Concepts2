POJO = Plain Old Java Object
It is a class that generally only has instance fields.
It is used to house data, and pass data, between functional classes.
It mainly has getters and setters.
Many database frameworks use it to read data from, or
write data to, databases, files or streams.

It also might be called a bean, or a JavaBean.
A JavaBean is just a POJO with some extra rules applied to it.

A POJO is sometimes called an Entity because it mirrors database entities.

Another acronym is DTO (Data Transfer Object).
It's a description of an object that can be modeled as just data.
